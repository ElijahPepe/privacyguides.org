  GrapheneOS is the best choice when it comes to privacy and security.

  GrapheneOS has a lot of security hardening and privacy improvements. It has a hardened memory allocator, network and sensor permissions, and various other security features. GrapheneOS also comes with full firmware updates and signed builds, so verified boot is fully supported.

  Notably, GrapheneOS supports Sandboxed Play Services. Google Play Services can be run fully sandboxed like a regular user app and contained in a work profile or user profile of your choice. This means that you can run apps dependant on Play Services, such as those that require push notifications using Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging service. GrapheneOS allows you to take advantage of most Google Play Services whilst having full user control over their permissions and access.

  Currently, only Pixel phones meet its hardware security requirement and are supported.

  Notes
  GrapheneOS's "extended support" devices do not have full security patches (firmware updates) due to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) discontinuing support. These devices cannot be considered completely secure.
