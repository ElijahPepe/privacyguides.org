  CalyxOS is a decent alternative to GrapheneOS.

  It has some privacy features on top of AOSP, such as the Datura firewall, Signal integration in the dialer app, and a built in panic button. CalyxOS also comes with firmware updates and signed builds, so verified boot is fully supported.

  To accomodate users who need Google Play Services, CalyxOS optionally includes MicroG. With MicroG, CalyxOS also bundles in the Mozilla and DejaVu location services.

  Currently, CalyxOS supports Google Pixel phones and the Xiaomi Mi A2. For legacy devices, CalyxOS offers "extended support" for much longer than GrapheneOS, making it a good choice once GrapheneOS has dropped support.

  Notes
  CalyxOS's "extended support" does not have full security patches due to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) discontinuing support, therefore they cannot be considered completely secure.

  With the Xiaomi Mi A2, CalyxOS does not distribute the latest firmware. Newer versions of the firmware prevented the device from performing verified boot.

  The Datura firewall can leak in some circumstances (see #572 and #581).
