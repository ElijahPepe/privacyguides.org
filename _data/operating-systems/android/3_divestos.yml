  DivestOS is a soft-fork of LineageOS.

  DivestOS inherits many supported devices from LineageOS. It has signed builds, making it possible to have verified boot on some non-Pixel devices.

  DivestOS has automated kernel vulnerability (CVE) patching, fewer proprietary blobs, a custom hosts file, along with bundled F-Droid as the app store. It also includes UnifedNlp for network location and some hardening with Mulch Webview. DivestOS also includes kernel patches from GrapheneOS and enables security features in defconfig.

  DivestOS also inherits LineageOS's iptables network access feature. You can deny network access to an individual application by pressing and holding on the app's icon (App info → Data and Network → Uncheck "Network Access").

  DivestOS 16.0 and 17.1 has GrapheneOS's hardened memory allocator. There are plans to port this to DivestOS 18.1.

  Notes
  DivestOS firmware update status varies across the devices it supports. For Pixel phones, we still recommend using GrapheneOS or CalyxOS. For other supported devices, DivestOS is a good alternative.

  Like CalyxOS's firewall, the network access toggle can also leak in some situations.

  Not all of the supported devices have verified boot and some perform it better than others.
