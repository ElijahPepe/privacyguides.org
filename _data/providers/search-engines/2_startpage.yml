  Startpage is a search engine that provides Google search results. It is a very convenient way to get Google search results without experiencing dark patterns such as difficult captchas or being refused access because you used a VPN or Tor.

  Notes
  Startpage's majority shareholder is System1 who is an adtech company. We don't think that is an issue as they have their own Privacy Policy.

  The Privacy Guides team reached out to Startpage back in 2020 for clarification and was satisfied by the answers we received.

  Startpage is based in the Netherlands.

  According to their Privacy Policy, they only log details such as\: operating system, type of browser and language. They do not log your IP address, search queries or other identifying information.

  Startpage proxies Google Search so Google does have access to your search queries.
