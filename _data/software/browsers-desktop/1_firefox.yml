  Extensions
  We normally do not recommend installing any extensions, as they have privileged access within your browser. We make an exception for uBlock Origin,
  a popular content blocker and üèÜÔ∏è Recommended Extension by Mozilla.

  Arkenfox (advanced)
  The Arkenfox project provides a set of carefully considered options for Firefox. These options are quite strict but a few are subjective and can sometimes cause a website to not work properly. You can easily change these settings to suit your needs. We strongly recommend reading through the basics section. Arkenfox also enables container support.
