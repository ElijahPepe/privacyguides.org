  uBlock Origin is a popular content blocker that could help you block ads, trackers, and fingerprinting scripts.

  We suggest enabling all of the filter lists under the "Ads", "Privacy" and "Malware domains". The "Annoyances" and "Multipurpose" lists can also be enabled, but they may break some social media functions. The AdGuard URL Tracking Protection filter list makes extensions like CleanURLs and NeatURLs redundant.

  We also suggest adding the Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool list and any of the regional lists that might apply to your browsing habits. Additional filter lists do slow things down, so only apply the languages that you use.

  uBlock Origin also has different blocking modes. The easy mode might not necessarily keep you safe from every tracker out there, whereas the more advanced modes let you control exactly what needs to run.
