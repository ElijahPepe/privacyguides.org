  Element is the reference client for the Matrix protocol, an open standard for secure decentralized real-time communication.

  Messages and files shared in private rooms (those which require an invite) are by default E2EE as are 1 to 1 voice and video calls.

  Notes
  Profile pictures, reactions, and nicknames are not encrypted.

  Group voice and video calls are not E2EE, and use Jitsi, but this is expected to change with Native Group VoIP Signalling. Group calls have no authentication currently, meaning that non room participants can also join the calls. We recommend that you do not use this feature for private meetings.

  When using element-web, you must trust the server hosting the Element client. If your threat model requires stronger protection then use a desktop or mobile client instead.

  Technical information
  The protocol was independently audited in 2016. The specification for the Matrix protocol can be found in their documentation. The Olm cryptographic ratchet used by Matrix is an implementation of Signal's Double Ratchet algorithm.
