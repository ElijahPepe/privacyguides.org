  The LBRY network is a decentralized video sharing network. It uses a BitTorrent-like network to store the video content, and a blockchain to store the indexes for those videos. The main benefit of this design is censorship resistance.

  The LBRY desktop client helps you stream videos from the LBRY network, and stores your subscription list in your own LBRY wallet.

  Notes
  We recommend against synchronizing your wallet with LBRY Inc., as synchronizing encrypted wallets is not supported yet. If you synchronize your wallet with LBRY Inc., you have to trust them to not look at your subscription list, LBC funds, or take control of your channel.

  Only the LBRY desktop client is recommended. The Odysee website and the LBRY clients in F-Droid, Play Store and the AppStore have mandatory synchronization and telemetry.

  While watching and hosting videos, your IP address is visible to the LBRY network. Consider using a VPN or Tor if your threat model requires hiding your IP address.

  You can also disable Save hosting data to help the LBRY network option (⚙️ Settings → Advanced Settings) to avoid exposing your IP address and watched videos when using LBRY for a prolonged period of time.
